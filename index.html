      My name is Logan Tao and I’m currently a first-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science from Timonium, Maryland. In high school, I was vice-president of our school’s First Robotics team and helped with outreach into our local community. We helped mentor elementary and middle school robotics teams and helped support a rookie First team compete in the First World Championship in Houston this year. Some of my other hobbies include going to the gym and working out, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.
